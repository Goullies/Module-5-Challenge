# Module-5-Challenge
## Part 1: Financial planning

In this challenge, we have been tasked with starting a fintech consulting firm. Tools will need to be designed to assess a number of aspects including financial buffers / savings health and model distibution before using Monte Carlo Simulations for retirement planning over a number of senarios.

 Firstly, information is sort regarding information on a persons share and crypto holdings. Then to establish their financial health, this data is modelled on the portfolio's data at todays prices to assess whether current funds are greater than the emergency benchmark of 3 months by creating some tools to forecast.

 ## Part 2: Retirement Planning

 Using portfolio data, the tools created model Monte Carlo Simulations over 5, 10 and 30 years and look at the distribution to calculate the expected portfolio return at 95% upper and lower confidence intervals using different initial investment amounts.

 Using a simular tool, projections were then undertaken for early retirement options with Monte Carlo Simulations completed on an intial investment over periods of 5 and 10 years.
